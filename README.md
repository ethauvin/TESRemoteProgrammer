Program your Telephone Entry System remotely (off-site) using your phone.

Most Telephone Entry Systems can be programmed from the front keypad, or remotely from an off-premise location using any touch-tone phone. TES Remote Programmer streamlines the often cumbersome remote programming process by providing data entry screens and automated dial-in options.

By default, TES Remote Programmer is configured to work with the [DoorKing (DKS) 1802-EPD](http://www.doorking.com/telephone/1802-entry-system) system, additional configurations can be created and imported for most systems supporting remote programming.
